# Wordle-Assist

## [Try it here!](https://wordle-cheater.streamlit.app)

A project created purely out of spite because my fiance is better at wordle than I am. 

This project predicts the most statistically probable solution, taking user input at each step.

It can be used in one of two ways:

* If a user is stuck, they can enter their guesses and recieve the best word recommendation
* A user can use the recommended words for each guess, resulting in the lowest possible average score (3.43 guesses on average, compared to the global user average of 4.02)

## Using the App

Load it up using the link above! If the app has not been opened by a user in some time, it may be necessary to wait a few moments for it to be redeployed by Streamlit.

You can load up the [official daily wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) or play an [unlimited puzzle](https://wordlegame.org).

The app sidebar provides an explanation of how to use the app to solve your wordle puzzle.
