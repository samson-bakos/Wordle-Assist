# Wordle-Assist

A project created purely out of spite because my fiance is better at wordle than I am. 

This project predicts the most statistically probable solution/ solution that will provide the most information for a wordle puzzle, taking user input at each step.

This project is similar to many other existing implementations, but it doesn't feel like I'm beating her if I didn't write the code myself :)
